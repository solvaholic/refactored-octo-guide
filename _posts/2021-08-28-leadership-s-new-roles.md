Back in, probably, 2012 I came across a paper about action mapping that concisely listed "Leadership’s new roles in an environment of unpredictability". Three bullet points cemented in my mind what effective leaders needed to do.

[The link I saved] for the paper names a host that's no longer available. However, I'm confident the relevant bit came from Bruce Matsui's [_Action Mapping: A Planning Tool for Change. HSLA Monograph._]:

> Leadership’s new roles in an environment of unpredictability include:  
> 1) the “art" of getting people to pay attention,  
> 2) the ability to manage energy resources, and  
> 3) the mastery of processes that reduce the uncertainty surrounding change

These points describe immediate actions and generally applicable skills. And I see clearly how they'll remain essential through changes to come. They resonate with me.

This week I read futurist Bob Johansen's book [_The New Leadership Literacies_]. I was surprised to see how relevant those 3 points still appear. And I was thrilled to find so much context and explanation and ready-to-use direction.

I'm excited about the uncertainty our future promises.
