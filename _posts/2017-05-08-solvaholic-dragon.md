"Serpent eating its tail" spends a lot of time in my mind when I ponder eternal recurrence or the fall of man, the danger of inefficiency or the responsibility that comes with growing, as well as vanity, selflessness, balance, and giving.

I had always envisioned it very crudely, or as an actual snake eating itself. In the summer of 2013, though, I went looking to see how others visualize it and was thrilled to find so many expressions.

Completely enchanted by the dragon eating its tail, I did the only reasonable thing: I went over to createmytattoo.com and found [PeppstaR](http://www.createmytattoo.com/PeppstaR), who helped me create my first colorful tattoo.
