I made [new notes](/github-pages.html) about setting up a GitHub Pages site locally. With fewer containers this time. Special thanks to @BDHU for updating the [Minimal] theme with dark mode and attractive-yet-simple links lists. :bow:

This past weekend I set out to add dark mode to this site and create a new post. I spent a bunch of time learning, cleaning up, and adding dark mode. I kept wanting to do more, though: The [Minimal] theme is still my favorite layout, but I had broken the 3-part _Downloads_ box from the theme and needed to fix where the links landed.

Right on time I came across this issue where @BDHU had just recently shared [their site](https://www.bodunhu.com):

<https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal/issues/91>

Boom. So I ran through the modifications on a newly created Pages site to answer a question in that issue and to get familiar with the content:

And then I spent way too much time tinkering on that, probably while procrastinating or avoiding some houshold chore. So here's this post with a link to the new notes. Now I'm going to go see what I've been putting off.
