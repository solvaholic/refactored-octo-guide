Want to turn your smartphone into an intelligent virtual assistant?  Tried building cloud-based mobile apps and had trouble with the kludge of tools online? or are you unsure where to start?

Wherever you are in that journey, [this Zero to Cognitive video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnJzIOiv6cVTaS8k90R3T9AlS_kf5XWmX) will catch you up and walk you through building a cognitive, conversational app.

IBM is doing more than just sharing their cool toys, though. IBM's getting [Bob Dill, Distinguished Engineer and CTO](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bob-dill-4335211), to show you how their toys work and how to get them up and running quickly.

Whatever your entry point, [this Zero to Cognitive video series](https://youtu.be/TI9Kf1Xmtfk?list=PLnJzIOiv6cVTaS8k90R3T9AlS_kf5XWmX) will walk you through building a cognitive, conversational app.
